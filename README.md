# Portfolio-site
Building a portfolio site as my first project of the ALC-Nanodegree. Contains information about recent projects completed and contacts.

## ISSUES:
**Does** not really render well as expected on devices with large `viewport` mostly above `900px`. It was made with **mobile devices** in mind.
**Note:**
That's not to say it doesn't work at all on devices with `viewport` above `900px`. It does works but just not as expected.

### CONTRIBUTIONS:
Contributions are not open to this project yet until further notice.
